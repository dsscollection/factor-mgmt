A repository with materials for the dsscollection submission "Wrangling categorical data in R" by Amelia McNamara and Nicholas J Horton.

The repository is broken into three directories:
- reviews, containing (non-blinded) reviews and our responses to them
- data, containing raw and slightly cleaned versions of the data
- analysis, containing all materials needed to reproduce the final PDF of the paper. This includes a `bibliography.bib` file, LaTeX style file `wlpeerj.cls`, an `Rproj` file, and a `packrat` directory that should help keep `R` package versions stable for reproducibility. 

The most up-to-date version of the PDF is available [here](https://github.com/dsscollection/factor-mgmt/blob/master/analysis/working_with_factors.pdf)
