	Annote = {``Teachers often come to professional development programs thinking that statistics is about mean, median, and mode. They know how to calculate these statistics, though they don't often have robust images about what they mean or how they're used. ''

``Konold and colleagues argue [...]
1. Data as a pointer to the data collection event but without a focus on actual data values;
2. Data as a focus on the identity of individual cases; and
3. Data as a classifier which focuses on frequencies of particular attribute values without an
overall view.''


Makes reference to the fact that TinkerPlots automatically promotes binning of variables, which means that binned plots were produced more often than they might have been with another software tool. This is about the affordances of the tool, what it makes natural and what is not. 

They even talk about using cut points!! This is like my example of the students turning a continuous numeric variable into a categorical variable (e.g. above and below the mean) and then using that in regression. Their choice of cut point made a big difference. },

In this physical model frequency corresponds to pressure, and fitting a statistical model by maximum likelihood corresponds to minimizing energy or balancing of forces. The model provides neat explanations of many results for categorical data, extends readily to multiway tables, and provides a rationale for the graphic representation of counts by area or visual density.},

@article{EmeGreSch2013,
	Abstract = {This article develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for this article are available online on the journal web site.},

	Annote = {A hierarchy of graph creation skills:
- prestructural/idiosyncratic
- unistructural
- multistructural
- relational

The order in which graph types are introduced is likely to reflect the complexity associated understanding the basic elements as other related aspects of mathematics are developing. Conservation of number and counting are clearly prerequisites for work with graphing, although early graphs can be used for reinforcement of counting and comparison skills. Categorical attributes, such as colors or fruit types, are likely to be understood before measurement attributes, for example, measuring with rulers. The related complexity of the scales for axes suggests an ordering such as categories (e.g., red, blue, green, ...), followed by whole number markings for ``stacking dots,'' then scales with markings in fractions or decimals between whole number values. Later interval scales associated with histograms may be quite variable and hence more complex.},
